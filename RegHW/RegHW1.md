# Regression HW1

---

*Use the following command to access the data*

``air <- read.csv('https://academics.hamilton.edu/mathematics/ckuruwit/Data/Air_Quality_E44.csv')``


(1) [3 pts] Draw a scatterplot of the carbone monoxide- CO(X) and ozone levels(Y).



(2) [3 pts] Briefly describe the relationship that you see. 



(3) [2 pts] Which cities stand out?



(4) [3 pts] Calculate the correlation coefficient between these two variables.




(5) [3 pts] Create a new data set (call it less_poluted_cities) by removing the 3 most extreme cities  

* Hint : Use the 'filter' function for this.  




(6) [2 pts] Then recalculate the correlation coeffient.  



(7) [4 pts] You will see that the correlation coefficient decrease quite a bit. Could you give a mathematical explaination to this decrease?

* Hint: Think about the definition of the correlation coefficient and the discussion we had using the quadrants.
