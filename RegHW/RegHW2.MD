# Regression HW 2


- The dataset below is for 2018, from EPA website ('https://www.epa.gov/air-trends/air-quality-cities-and-counties')
- The whole dataset has many variables and lots of missing values.  What we have is a cleaned version.  
- Both CO and O3 are measured in parts per million (ppm).



### Use the following command to access the data.

```Air_Quality_2018 <- read.csv('https://academics.hamilton.edu/mathematics/ckuruwit/Data/Air_quality_2018.csv')```


### Answer the following questions:

1. [3 pts] Draw a scatter plot to look at the relationship between the $CO$ level($X$) using $O3$ ($Y$). Add the regression line(line of best fit) into your # scatterplot.  Attach your plot.


2. [2 pts] Write down the equation of the fitted line using proper notation.


3. [3 pts] Interpret (in context) the y-intercept of your model.  If you can't interpret it please explain why.


4. [3 pts] Interpret (in context) the slope of your model. Make sure to not imply any causation.


5. [3 pts] What is the $R^2$ of your model. Interpret this value in context.


6. [3 pts] What is the average prediction error of your model.  Is this a 'large' error or 'small'.  Briefly explian.
