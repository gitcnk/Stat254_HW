## The purpose of this HW is to show the connection of the Gini score to the concept of variance in categorical outcomes.

**Definition:** 
Gini = $1 - \sum_{j=1}^k p_j^2$

where $p_j$ is probability of class 'j' and k is the muber of classes.  For example, k = 2 for binary outcomes.

Show the following results:

1. For binary outcomes, Gini = $p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2)$

2. For outcomes with 3 classes (eg. Cancer, No Cancer, Maybe), Gini = $p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2)+ p_3(1-p_3)$
